# MIS-310-IA-8-Robert-Wildman
These are the projects for MIS 310 I made in Spring 2025.
All of them started out as in-class or homework assignments.
Program 1: Calculator

This is a basic calculator program.  
However, I made the program my own by adding support for square roots, percentages, and parentheses.
This was done by adding a new row to the calculator and using the math module to evaluate square roots.

Program 2: Factorial Calculator

Here, I've made a GUI for the program and also have included exception handling for invalid inputs.
To use the program, all you need to do is enter a nonnegative integer and it will give you its factorial.

Program 3: Grade Calculator

This program takes the average of 5 grades and returns a letter
grade based on the average. I added functionality to the program by adding a GUI.

Program 4: Painting Estimation

This program gives you the cost of a painting job based on wall area, the cost of paint, and
the cost of labor. The ability to change the labor rate as well as the GUI are improvements I
made to the original program.

Program 5: Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is the program I spent the most time on. It's a rock paper scicors game 

Program 6: Seating Calculator

Program 7: Unit Converter
