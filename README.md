# MIS-310-IA-8-Robert-Wildman
These are the projects for MIS 310 I made in Spring 2025.
All of them started out as in-class or homework assignments.
Program 1: Calculator

This is a basic calculator program.  
However, I made the program my own by adding support for square roots, percentages, and parentheses.
This was done by adding a new row to the calculator and using the math module to evaluate square roots.

Program 2: Factorial Calculator

Here, I've made a GUI for the program and also have included exception handling for invalid inputs.
To use the program, all you need to do is enter a nonnegative integer and it will give you its factorial.

Program 3: Grade Calculator

This program takes the average of 5 grades and returns a letter
grade based on the average. I added functionality to the program by adding a GUI.

Program 4: Painting Estimation

This program gives you the cost of a painting job based on wall area, the cost of paint, and
the cost of labor. The ability to change the labor rate as well as the GUI are improvements I
made to the original program.

Program 5: Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is the program I spent the most time on. It's a rock-paper-scissors game with a GUI.
Originally, the program was all text-based, but the GUI was added by me, alongside a button and scoreboard
that resets and keeps track of wins, respectively.

Program 6: Seating Calculator

This program calculates the total revenue earned for ticket sales of different classes of seats.
The program did not have a GUI originally, so I added one.

Program 7: Unit Converter

This program converts the U.S. customary units of miles, gallons, and acres to their metric counterparts.
The GUI was added by me as well as the unit conversions from gallons to liters and acres to hectacres.
