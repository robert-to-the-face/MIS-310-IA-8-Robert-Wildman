# MIS-310-IA-8-Robert-Wildman
These are the projects for MIS 310 I made in Spring 2025.

Program 1: Calculator

This is a basic calculator program. We made this as part of an assignment for class. 
However, I made the program my own by adding support for square roots, percentages, and parentheses.
This was done by adding a new row to the calculator and using the math module to evaluate square roots.

Program 2: Factorial Calculator

This program was originally an in-class assignment.
Here, I've made a GUI for the program and also have included exception handling invalid inputs.

Program 3: Grade Calculator

Program 4: Painting Estimation

Program 5: Rock Paper Scissors Game

Program 6: Seating Calculator

Program 7: Unit Converter
